## Here is something for my MANUALLY installed Swift.
## Commands I used to install it:
##
##    curl -O https://download.swift.org/swift-5.7.2-release/xcode/swift-5.7.2-RELEASE/swift-5.7.2-RELEASE-osx.pkg
##    sudo installer -dumplog -verbose -target LocalSystem -pkg swift-5.7.2-RELEASE-osx.pkg
##
## I choose LocalSystem b/c I'm on an older MacOS that has NO swift under /usr/lib
## And when I install the latest compatible FULL Xcode -- there is STILL NO swift under /usr/lib
## Also Xcode did not add swift to /Library/Developer/Toolchains/... either.
## So, there should be no possibility of interference since my installation provided
## the first and only copy of Swift that will ever "live" on this older system.
