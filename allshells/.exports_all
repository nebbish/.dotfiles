	#    them into separate files, using a "._" prefix, and storing them in the archive.
	#    For these utiltiies that do this -- they also go the other way and convert
	#    files having the prefix "._" into attributes, and re-attaching them to the
	#    corresponding file.

	export COPYFILE_DISABLE=1
