# This "tweak" allows the BASH "reverse-i-search" feature to go forward
#   a) pressing CTRL-r begins the "reverse-i-search" feature
#   b) once started, regular typing performs search
#   c) then, repeated CTRL-r cmds cycle through matches in reverse
#   d) then, repeated CTRL-s cmds switch to "i-search" and then cycle FORWARD through matches
# Without this "tweak", the (d) feature will not work
