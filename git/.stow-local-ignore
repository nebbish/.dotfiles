## Ignore directives for my ????? package (also some notes for reference ;)
## See:  https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/Types-And-Syntax-Of-Ignore-Lists.html

##
## These are Perl regular expressions, one per line
## Comments and blank lines are allowed.
##

##
## NOTE:  if there is a '/' in the expression ANYWHERE, it is handled by (1) below
##        otherwise, the expression is handled by (2) below
##
##  Stow will, for each item, build a path relative to the "top-level" package directory,
##  prefix it with a '/', then runs all of the (1) expressions:
##      1) if a regex *exactly* matches a **SUBPATH** of the calc. rel. path:  IGNORE it
##
##  If not yet ignored, the current item's 'basename' is put through the (2) expressions:
##      2) if a regex *exactly* matches:   IGNORE it
##

## vim swap files
\..*?\.sw\w

## Everything specific for now
