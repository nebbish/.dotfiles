# On MacOS the `/etc/zprofile` init file inclues the new `/usr/libexec/path_helper` utility
# which:   automatically puts ALL adjusted path items at the end :(
#
# So one part of a fix is to setup our own path in `~/.zprofile` which runs after `/etc/zprofile`
# Ok so far :)
#
# However, screen & tmux utilities that create Z-sub-shells will inherit inheritable values
# like $PATH, and then both the `/etc/zprofile` and `~/.zprofile` will run again...
# In these situations - our customizations will appear TWICE
#    /etc/zprofile runs first:   removes duplicates, moves customizations to end
#    ~/.zprofile   runs  next:   prepends custom values
#
# We get around this by:  have our own "smart" adjustment after pre-pending our custom values
# Entering the scene is the helper script named:    `path_remove_duplicates.py`
