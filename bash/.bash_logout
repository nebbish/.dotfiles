# ~/.bash_logout


##
## Just including in my one logout file, Ubuntu22 default content:
##
# ~/.bash_logout: executed by bash(1) when login shell exits.

# when leaving the console clear the screen to increase privacy

##
## Disabling this -- I don't like it, and I can *eeeaasily* Ctrl-L when I want.
##
#if [ "$SHLVL" = 1 ]; then
#    [ -x /usr/bin/clear_console ] && /usr/bin/clear_console -q
#fi
