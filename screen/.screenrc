# I found this necessary on my older CentOS 7.2 box - where the OS still attempts
# to help set $TERM using the script here:  /etc/profile.d/256term.sh
# After debugging a bit - I learned that script is doing nothing, and so if we
# want $TERM to be something other than plain 'screen' we set it here
term screen-256color

# Not sure the best way to make this shell-specific -- maybe a plain 'if' statement
# but for ZSH, the '%' should match the prompt, and for BSH '$' would match
#
# To make this work, setup the PROMPT_COMMAND to output `Esc k Esc \`
# (we do this with character codes for 'Esc':033 and '\':134)
#      PROMPT_COMMAND='printf "\033k\033\134"'
